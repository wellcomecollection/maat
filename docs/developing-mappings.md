# Developing new mappings

Experimental mappings can be tested by modifying the local mapping in `/data/mappings` and running [`yarn TODO`](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/rank/issues/49). The script will reindex the catalogue data into a new index using your local mapping.

Rank defaults to using the live mappings. To see the result of your changes, toggle the ðŸ§ª on the `/search` page.
